# An Introduction to Able

> Start with Unity Editor Open and Able package window displayed

**I am in the process of creating software to make Unity game development scripting easier and more powerful. My first package, Able, is a broad spread of essential functions that I need for the more targeted releases to come.**

> Open http://www.askowl.net/askowl-base-library-enabler

**Able consists of classes and functions that you can use in your unity script. Install it from the Asset Store or a disk file as I am doing here. Everything installs in a directory in Assets called Askowl.**

**The documentation directory contains the markdown source for off-line review. It is available online (http://www.askowl.net/askowl-base-library-enabler).**

> Open https://www.patreon.com/paulmarrington

 **The address is linked in the notes below, from the source, on the Unity Store and from my Patreon site (https://www.patreon.com/paulmarrington).**

> Open Doxygen link from main documentation

**Doxygen generated pages provide an additional perspective. The link can be found just after the executive summary.**

> Return to Unity Editor and display Editor Directory

**The next directory contains Unity Editor specific support.**

**Able includes full unit testing from the Examples directory. As the directory name implies, it is the best place to see the scripts in use.**

**There is currently only one resource, being the default post-processing data for building Android and iOS games.**

**And finally, we get to the meat in the scripts directory. Because Able contains a diverse set of supporting code, I have divided it up into some high-level categories.**

**Anything that is mostly about numbers gets put into the Math directory.**

**Data structures, collections and the like are in Memory.**

**No library would be complete without some text processing to aid I/O.**

**Finally, there are a few Unity-specific classes for your entertainment.**
